# Source: istio/charts/security/templates/cleanup-secrets.yaml
# The reason for creating a ServiceAccount and ClusterRole specifically for this
# post-delete hooked job is because the citadel ServiceAccount is being deleted
# before this hook is launched. On the other hand, running this hook before the
# deletion of the citadel (e.g. pre-delete) won't delete the secrets because they
# will be re-created immediately by the to-be-deleted citadel.
#
# It's also important that the ServiceAccount, ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding
# will be ready before running the hooked Job therefore the hook weights.
