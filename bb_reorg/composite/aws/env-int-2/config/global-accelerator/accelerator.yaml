  # Indicates whether the accelerator is enabled. The value is true or false. The default value is true.
  # If the value is set to true, the accelerator cannot be deleted. If set to false, accelerator can be deleted.

  # An ID for the endpoint. If the endpoint is a Network Load Balancer or Application Load Balancer, this is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource.
  # A resource must be valid and active when you add it as an endpoint. If the endpoint is an Elastic IP address, this is the Elastic IP address allocation ID.
  # For Amazon EC2 instances, this is the EC2 instance ID.

  ###
  # EndpointConfigurations for UDP listeners will be set manual because we need to set here
  # EC2 instance ID or Elastic IP, so we can use EC2 instance ID for PoC but we will need to automate how they will be
  # fetched and updated here.
